# Google Search Bar UI

This project is a front-end recreation of the Google search bar's user interface using HTML and CSS. The goal was to meticulously replicate the design, including its clean layout, styling, and interactive elements, to demonstrate proficiency in core web development technologies.

## Features

-   **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file provides a well-organized and semantic structure for the search bar, with a clear hierarchy of elements for the search icon, input field, and voice search button.
-   **CSS Styling**: The `stylesheet.css` file contains all the styling, using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox for alignment and layout. It also includes detailed styling for elements like the input field, hover effects, and rounded corners to match the original design.
-   **SVG Integration**: High-quality, scalable vector graphics are used for both the search and voice icons. This ensures the icons remain crisp and clear on any screen size or resolution.
-   **Hover Effects**: A subtle box shadow is added to the search bar on hover, enhancing the user experience and visual appeal.

## Files

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that provides the structure and content of the page.
-   `stylesheet.css`: The CSS file responsible for the visual styling and layout of the search bar.
